//* The most common primitive data type in TypeScript is String, Number and Boolean.
//* Other data types are Array, Object, Function, Enum, Interface, null and undefined.
var myName = "Mir";
//* By doing this, the typescript will infer the data type
//* and it will set the data type of myName to string ( myName: string )
//* so know i wont be able to assign any other data type. For example myName = 12 
var age;
